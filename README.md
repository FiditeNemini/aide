**Aide is the Open Source AI-native code editor. It is a fork of VS Code, and integrates tightly with [the leading agentic framework](https://github.com/codestoryai/sidecar) on swebench-lite.**

Aide combines the powerful features of VS Code with advanced AI capabilities to provide:

* **A combined chat + edit flow** - Brainstorm a problem in chat by referencing files and jump into edits (which can happen across multiple files).
* **Proactive agents** - AI iterates on linter errors (provided by the Language Server) and pulls in relevant context using go-to-definitions, go-to-references, etc to propose fixes or ask for more context from you.
* **Inline editing widget** - Similar to the macos spotlight widget, press Ctrl/Cmd+K at any point to give instructions to AI.
* **Intelligent Code Completion** - Context-aware code suggestions powered by state-of-the-art AI models.
* **AST navigation** - Quickly navigate files in blocks rather than line-by-line.

Aide is designed to be your intelligent coding companion, helping you write better code faster while maintaining full control over your development process.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge [Cody](https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody) for Open Sourcing and creating the inline completion bit. This is one of those parts of the codebase where we borrowed heavily from Cody's work and we are grateful for that. We added our own necessities on top of this to make it work with the `sidecar`.
This part of the codebase is no longer maintained, we have since moved forward our focus to working on agentic workflows and if you want to revamp this part, please let us know!
We believe inline completion UX is ripe for innovation and there are many directions we can take this.
